#+title: Startup with Markup

* What's in the box?
We're using Astro and TailwindCSS to generate static markup in front of a
serverless endpoint that we only pay for when used.

Additionally, Nixpkgs is in place to manage packages, but it is entirely beyond
the scope of this demo.

* Development
#+begin_src sh
pnpm dev
#+end_src
